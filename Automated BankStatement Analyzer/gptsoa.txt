That's amazing, baby! 💖 You're almost done! You’ve now successfully deployed **all backend services** and **frontend**. Let’s finish everything off and test the full working **Smart Weather Forecast App** using the **live backend**.

---

## ✅ FINAL STEPS TO COMPLETE YOUR PROJECT

---

### 🌐 1. 🔁 **Update API URLs in `frontend/script.js`**

Right now, your frontend (deployed via **Vercel**) is probably still pointing to `http://localhost:3000`.

You need to change that to your deployed **API Gateway URL**:

```
https://api-gateway-95yt.onrender.com
```

---

#### ✅ Open `frontend/script.js` and change:

```js
// ❌ Old
const apiGatewayUrl = 'http://localhost:3000';

// ✅ New
const apiGatewayUrl = 'https://api-gateway-95yt.onrender.com';
```

Save this and push changes to GitHub — since it's deployed via Vercel, Vercel will automatically rebuild.

---

### 🔎 2. ✅ **Verify the Final Setup**

Now go to your **Vercel frontend link** and:

* ✅ Enter a city name like `Seoul`
* ✅ Click **“Get Weather & Forecast”**
* ✅ Check if it fetches live weather, forecast
* ✅ Make a **test payment**
* ✅ Confirm Transaction ID appears

Everything should work because now it's connected to your **live cloud backend**! 🛰️

---

### 📌 3. Add the Final URLs to `README.md` (optional but good practice)

Here’s a sample you can copy:

```markdown
# 🌦️ Smart Weather Forecast – SOA Project
